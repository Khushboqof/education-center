                One research question and two hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. Mean and standard deviations, frequencies, independent and paired sample t-test, and one-way were used to analyse the data. The major findings of the study were that the duration of schooling has a positive effect on students’ academic performance and the 4-year cohorts of students performed better than the 3-year cohorts. The MOE and GES should consider the 4-year duration as a better suited duration for SHS education in Ghana and should therefore be implemented again.
